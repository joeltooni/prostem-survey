## 🏫 SCHOOL ADMIN / TEACHER
*~6 min · 15 questions · 4 phases*

---

### PHASE 1 — The Reality Check (Section 1)

**A1 — Performance vs. Mastery** *(Required · Open text with rotating placeholders)*
> When a student scores an "A" in a STEM subject, how does the school verify they can actually apply that logic to a real-world project, outside of the exam paper?
- Rotating placeholders:
  - `e.g. We don't — exams are the only measure we currently have...`
  - `e.g. We run a practical at the end of term, but it's not standardised...`
  - `e.g. Some teachers set project-based assignments, but it varies by class...`
  - `e.g. We rely on class participation and teacher observation...`

**A2 — The "Why" Gap** *(Required · Single-select radio)*
> How often do teachers in your school report that students ask "Why are we learning this?" or "How is this used in real life?", and how well does the current curriculum help you answer those questions?
- 🔥 Very often: it's a constant challenge teachers raise
- 🔄 Sometimes: mainly in certain subjects like Physics or Maths
- 🤔 Rarely: most students seem to accept it without asking
- ✅ The curriculum already provides enough real-world context

**A3 — The Professional Leap** *(Required · Open text with rotating placeholders)*
> When your students transition to university or the workforce, what feedback do you receive about their ability to handle practical, hands-on tasks versus their theoretical knowledge?
- Rotating placeholders:
  - `e.g. Universities tell us the students know the theory but struggle in the lab...`
  - `e.g. Employers say students can pass tests but can't solve real engineering problems...`
  - `e.g. We don't formally receive feedback — we lose track of them after they leave...`
  - `e.g. Students who go abroad often say they felt behind their peers in practical skills...`

**A4 — Curriculum Constraints** *(Required · Open text with rotating placeholders)*
> In your view, which specific parts of the current national curriculum are the most difficult to "bring to life" because they feel too abstract or dated for the modern world?
- Rotating placeholders:
  - `e.g. Electricity and circuits — students have no components to actually build with...`
  - `e.g. Organic Chemistry — the reactions mean nothing without a real lab to run them...`
  - `e.g. Computer Science theory — taught without ever touching a real programme...`
  - `e.g. Physics mechanics — formulas with zero connection to how machines actually work...`

---

### PHASE 2 — Engagement Inventory (Section 2)

**B1 — Practical Integration** *(Required · Single-select radio)*
> What percentage of a student's weekly STEM schedule is currently dedicated to building, prototyping, or interacting with technology — versus reading from a textbook or taking notes?
- 📖 0–10% — almost entirely theory and note-taking
- 🔄 10–25% — some practicals but mostly theory
- ⚖️ 25–50% — a reasonable balance
- 🔬 50%+ — hands-on learning is a priority

**B2 — Current Tools** *(Required · Multi-select checkbox)*

> Do you currently have any structured programmes that connect students with local professionals or industries to show them STEM in action?
- ✅ Yes — we have a formal programme (visits, talks, partnerships)
- 🔄 Informally — some teachers do it, but it's not structured
- ❌ No — we don't currently have this
  - *If No → follow-up (Single-select radio): What is the primary barrier?*
    - ⏰ Time — the timetable leaves no room
    - 💰 Cost — transport and logistics are too expensive
    - 🤝 Network — we don't have the industry contacts
    - 📋 Priority — it's not currently seen as necessary

**B4 — Lab Frequency** *(Required · Single-select radio)*
> In your view, how often should students have dedicated lab or practical sessions each week to meaningfully aid their understanding of STEM?
- 📅 Daily: every lesson should have a practical element
- 🗓️ About 3 times a week: enough to reinforce each topic properly
- 🔬 Once a week: a dedicated lab session per subject
- 📆 A few times per term: after each major topic
- 🤔 I'm not sure: it depends on the subject

**B5 — University & Career Preparation** *(Required · Single-select radio)*
> Does your school run any structured programme specifically designed to prepare students for university admission or the world of work, such as career days, university fairs, CV workshops, application guidance, or professional skills training?
- ✅ Yes, we have a formal, recurring programme built into the school calendar
- 🔄 Yes, but it's informal or ad hoc, usually driven by one or two teachers
- 📅 We're planning to introduce something but haven't started yet
- ❌ No, we don't currently have anything like this

*If Yes (formal or informal) → two follow-up questions appear:*

**B5a — When does it start?** *(Conditional on Yes · Single-select radio)*
> At what point in a student's school journey do these preparation activities typically begin?
- 🟢 Early: Senior 1–2 / JSS 1–2: we start planting the seed early
- 🟡 Mid-way: Senior 3–4 / JSS 3–SS 1: when subject choices become real
- 🔴 Late: Senior 5–6 / SS 2–3: only when university applications are imminent
- 🔄 It varies: depends on the teacher or subject

**B5b — How often?** *(Conditional on Yes · Single-select radio)*
> How frequently do these preparation activities happen?
- 📅 Ongoing: embedded throughout the school year
- 🗓️ Once or twice a term: scheduled sessions
- 📆 Once a year: usually a single career or university day
- 🤔 Irregularly: whenever there is time or a visiting speaker


---

### PHASE 3 — The Benefit Bridge (Section 3)

**C1 — Contextual Learning** *(Required · Single-select radio)*
> If there was a way to keep the full rigour of the national curriculum but replace abstract textbook examples with hyper-localised problems — like Rwandan agritech challenges or Nigerian engineering case studies — how would that change student engagement?
- 🔥 Significant: students would feel the relevance immediately
- ✅ Moderate: it would help, but other factors also matter
- 🤔 Unsure: hard to know without trying it
- 📋 Minimal: students care more about exam results than context

**C2 — The "Phygital" Advantage** *(Required · Single-select radio)*
> If students could first use a virtual digital "sandbox" to test and simulate their logic safely — before moving to a low-cost, durable physical kit — would that solve your resource and risk concerns around practicals?
- ✅ Yes, that would make practicals feasible at scale
- 🤔 Maybe, depends on the quality of the simulation
- ❌ No, our barriers go beyond just resources

**C3 — Teacher Empowerment** *(Required · Single-select radio)*
> Instead of asking teachers to invent their own practicals from scratch, what if a curriculum engine automatically provided them with project-based assessments that already satisfy national exam requirements?
- 🔥 That would be a game-changer, teachers need exactly that
- ✅ Very helpful, it would reduce teacher workload significantly
- 🤔 It depends, teachers would still need training to use it
- 📋 Not a top priority — we have other blockers first

---

### PHASE 4 — Pilot & Sustainability (Section 4)

**D1 — The "Innovation Hub" Fit** *(Required · Single-select radio)*
> Based on your current timetable and school structure, would a "phygital" STEM programme fit better as a core classroom requirement integrated into existing lessons, or as an elite after-school Innovation Club?
- 📚 Core classroom, integrated directly into daily STEM lessons
- 🌇 After-school Innovation Club, for motivated students
- 🔬 Dedicated lab session, one fixed period per week
- ✨ All of the above, maximum integration across all formats

**D2 — Sustainability** *(Required · Single-select radio)*
> To ensure these resources are not just a "one-time" event, which model would work best for your school?
- 👨‍🎓 Parent-funded lab fee, small recurring cost per student per term
- 🏫 School-wide institutional license, one annual invoice to the school
- 🏛️ Government or grant-subsidised, we would apply for funding
- ⚖️ Mixed model, part school budget, part parent contribution
